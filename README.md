# Business-API
Doing business in Nigeria is difficult alright. Doing business with businesses in Nigeria involves another set of complexities, oen of which is the lack of standard and defined way of identifying and validating businesses. Say like a sort of a KYC.

## This is project addresses this issue by exposing REST endpoints to;
 - Verify and get a business details by their unique assigned RC number
- Checks if a company exists by name
- Checks if a cmopany name and RC number matches

Head over here to check out these endpoints and see how you can use them.

## NB; All data used in this project are gotten from public search at https://publicsearch.cac.gov.ng/ComSearch/index.php and are valid as at 05/07/2020

This project is more of a demo project, I do not recommend using it for your production applications.
